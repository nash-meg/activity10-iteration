```

In this activity, we will continue working with the data from Activity 6 (Pivoting).

## Set-up

For this activity, you will need the `{tidyverse}` and `{broom}` packages.




### The data

Hamermesh and Parker gathered their data from end of semester student evaluations for a large sample of professors from the University of Texas at Austin.
In addition, six students rated their professorsâ€™ physical appearance.
Note that the data we have is a slightly modified version of the original data set that was released as part of the replication data for *Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models* (Gelman and Hill, 2007).
The result is a data frame where each row contains a different course and columns represent variables about the courses and professors.

The data are stored in the repo's `data` folder as `evals-mod.csv`.

### Data preparation

We've been mostly dealing with column-wise data summaries in this class, but there are times when we want to take information across multiple columns and summarize this as a new value.
In Activity 5.2 you did this by using `tidyr::pivot_longer` to lengthen the data before calculating averages by each instructor.
Here we will explore the `dplyr::rowwise` function.

Complete the code chunk below by filling in the blanks so that you *create* a new variable called `bty_avg` that is the average attractiveness score of the six students for each professor (`bty_f1lower` through `bty_m2upper`) and add this new variable to the `evals` dataset.

The [`rowwise`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/rowwise.html) documentation will be helpful for seeing additional examples of using this function.  

```{r rowwise-mean}
_____ <- _____ %>% 
  rowwise() %>% 
  ______(bty_avg = mean(c_across(___________:___________))) %>% 
  ungroup()
```

The `rowwise` function works a lot like `group_by`, except that it groups the data frame one row at a time so that any operation applied to the data frame is done once per each row.
This is useful to calculate the mean beauty score for each row, but we do not want to continue only working on each row for the rest of this activity.

## Exploratory data analysis

Visualize the distribution of `score` (only).
Describe this distribution and comment on what this tells you about how students rate courses.
Is this what you expected to see?
Why, or why not?
Also, include any numerical summary statistics (uses a `dplyr::summarise` pipeline, not the `BASE::summary` function) that will help in making your response more effective.




**Response**:


A note on the `BASE::summary` function.
This function along with the `{skimr}` package provide a lot of information with just a small bit of code.
However, this is too much information (and "lazy") when doing a report that does not present in a human-readable table.
We will shortly see some better methods for linear model output, but you have a lot of great `{dplyr}` skills to intentionally create great summary tables!

Visualize the distribution of `score` and the new variable that you created, `bty_avg`.
Be sure to adjust for overplotting (e.g., `alpha` and/or jittering)

Create a new plot that is similar to the previous plot, but also indicates the `gender` of the professor.

## Linear Models 

Recall from one of your past statistics courses, that linear models take the form: $Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + ... + \beta_k X_k + \varepsilon$;, if we have $k$ predictors.
If we have a dataset `df` that has three variables (`y`, `x1`, and `x2`), we can fit this linear model using the `lm` function:

```
lm(y ~ x1 + x2, data = df)
```

Fit a linear model and assign it to `mod_bty_gender` to predict the average professor evaluation `score` by average beauty rating (`avg_bty`) and the professor's `gender`.




Compare the output from simply running `mod_bty_gender` **and** using the `broom::tidy` function on your model object.
Based on the `tidy` output, write the fitted linear model using appropriate variable names and model estimates.
Interpret the intercept and slopes of the linear model in the context of the data.
Be sure to comment on whether each of these values makes sense in this context.
Also, use your `{dplyr}` skills on this `tidy` output to only include the model terms, parameter estimates, and standard errors. 



**Response**:


Re-plot your last visualization, but now add the linear regression line(s) to this plot.
Be sure to turn off the shading for the uncertainty of the line.




Use the `broom::glance` function to view model diagnostics.




Comment on the overall fit by looking at your new visualization and these model summary statistics.

**Response**:




Compare the `tidy` and `glanced` output to running `summary(mod_bty_gender)`.
I hope you noticed that with this little bit of code, you get a lot of information.
Again, I am a big believer of being intentional about what you output (especially for reports).

## Many models

Now what we would like to do is fit similar models (i.e., $Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \varepsilon$) to each of the instructor `rank`.

To do this, we can nest the appropriate data for each of the `rank`, then use `map` to obtain models with similar parameters for each of the instructor `rank`.
To simplify things, we will only bring along the information that we want to work with: `rank`, `score`, `bty_avg`, and `gender`.

Recall from previous readings and primers that data frames/tibbles can have columns that contain data frames/tibbles themselves.
A general nesting process to do this for a particular grouping variable is to take the dataset, `group_by` the grouping variable, then `nest`.
For example:

```
nested_data <- data %>%
  group_by(grouping_variable) %>%
  nest()
```

Using the `evals` data, 

- *select* only the variables `rank`, `score`, `bty_avg`, and `gender`,
- *group by* `ranks`,
- *nest* the columns and rows of the other variables.

Make sure that you provide a meaningful object name.
You should have a tibble with 3 rows and two columns.



What are the two column names?
Can you change the second column's name?
If so, how?

**Response**:


Now that we have the nested dataset, we can use `map` to fit a `lm` with the same variables to each nested `data`set.
In general, we could do this like:

```
nested_data %>% 
  mutate(model = map(data, ~lm(model, data = .)))
```

Here, `model` is the specified linear equation that we wish to fit (e.g., `y ~ x1 + x2`).

Fit these three models to your data and *overwrite* the appropriate object.
In addition to fitting a `model` column to your, include the following columns with the corresponding information:

- `tidied`: a column of the model summaries of your `model` column (hint: `broom::tidy`),
- `glanced`: a column of the model diagnostic summary statistics of your `model` column (hint: `broom::glance`), and
- `augmented`: a column of the model residual outputs of your `model` column (hint: `broom::augment`).

You should have a tibble that has three rows and 6 columns (`rank`, `data`, `model`, `tidied`, `glanced`, `augmented`).




## Many models diagnostics

Your nested dataset has a lot of information stored within it.
Now we will see how we can use this information to find insight.

The "back-transformation" to `nest`ing data is to `unnest` it.
You can `unnest` multiple columns simultaneously (see the documentation for examples), but we will only focus on one at a time.
In general, you can unnest a column by:

```
nested_data %>%
  unnest(nested_column)
```

`unnest` your dataset by the `tidied` column.
Plot the estimated regression coefficients for your three models (this would be a good opportunity to use a `facet_*` layer) and provide a brief discussion comparing these values.




**Response**:

`unnest` your dataset by the `glanced` column..
Plot the `r.squared`s for your three models and provide a brief discussion comparing these values and commenting on the models' appropriateness.




**Response**:


`unnest` your dataset by the `glanced` column..
Plot the residuals vs. fitted values provide a brief discussion commenting on the models' appropriateness.
